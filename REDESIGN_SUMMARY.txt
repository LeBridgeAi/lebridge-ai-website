NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. TEST LOCALLY:
   Open in browser: file:///Users/guillaumedechalambert/LeBridge_AI_Ecosystem/01_PROJECTS/lebridge-ai-website/index.html

2. CONFIGURE SCHEDULE FORM:
   - Update form action in pages/schedule.html
   - Replace "YOUR_FORM_ID" with actual Formspree ID
   - Or connect to your preferred form backend

3. DEPLOY TO GITHUB PAGES:
   cd /Users/guillaumedechalambert/LeBridge_AI_Ecosystem/01_PROJECTS/lebridge-ai-website
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: complete website redesign with header polish and navigation simplification"
   git push origin main

4. VERIFY LIVE:
   https://lebridge.ai

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

- Old pages (about.html, intake.html, services.html) are still available but
  not linked in main navigation. Can be removed or kept for backward compatibility.

- The schedule.html form uses Formspree. You'll need to configure with a form ID
  from https://formspree.io or replace with your preferred form service.

- All styling uses CSS variables (--bg-primary, --text-primary, etc.) for
  easy theme customization in the future.

- The site is fully responsive and tested for mobile/tablet views.
