## Date: January 30, 2026
## Status: ✅ Ready for Review

---

## CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Header Redesign
- **Brand name**: Changed from "LeBridge AI" to "LeBridge" (uppercase L and B)
- **Font styling**: Increased size to 22px, letter-spacing to 3px, made uppercase
- **Navigation**: Simplified to single item: "ArKiteK Studio" styled as purple logo (20px, #a78bfa)
- **Removed**: "Home" and "Schedule" navigation items (home is logo, schedule in CTA)

### 2. Hero Section Complete Rewrite
**New headline**: "Build AI systems that scale with your operations."
**New subheading**: "We design the architecture. You own the execution."
**New supporting text**: "Most organizations treat AI as a tool problem. We treat it as a systems problem. That's why our clients end up with systems that actually scale."

**New visual diagram**:
- Purple-themed box with border
- "DEFINE AI BEHAVIOR" header
- "Authority • Boundaries • Language • Judgment" subtitle
- Flow: AI SYSTEM (BEFORE) → EXECUTION
  - Clear boundaries / Defined context → Consistent behavior / Reliable decisions

**Removed**:
- Old flow diagram (Business Reality → ArKiteK → Execution)
- "For teams ready..." note text
- Complex multi-element flow

### 3. Problem Section (Unchanged)
Kept "Why most AI implementations fail at scale" section as-is:
- Ad-hoc automation
- Execution drift
- Team friction

### 4. Approach Section Redesigned
**New title**: "Our approach: Systems-first AI"

**New 4-item grid** (replaced old ArKiteK section):
1. **Architectural Precision** - Design before execution
2. **Operational Alignment** - Every decision tied to context
3. **Executive Clarity** - Defensible decisions
4. **Deliberate Scaling** - Repeatable, auditable, sustainable

Each item has purple border, subtitle in purple, clean description.

**Removed**:
- Old "The AI Operating System" section
- Complex diagram with signals/qualifiers/behavior categories
- ArKiteK-specific technical explanation

### 5. Timeline Section (Unchanged)
Kept "How we work with you" 3-stage timeline as-is.

### 6. CTA Section Updated
**New copy**:
- Title: "Ready to build AI infrastructure that scales?"
- Description: "Let's talk about your operations and design the system that moves you forward."
- Primary CTA: "Schedule a working session" → pages/schedule.html
- Secondary CTA: "View our system design approach" → pages/arkitek-os.html

**Removed**:
- "No lock-in. No black boxes." note

### 7. Footer Refinement
- Reduced top margin: 88px → 64px
- Reduced padding: 56px → 48px
- More compact, less "lost in space"

## CONTENT STRATEGY CHANGES

### Old Story:
"Systems-first AI infrastructure, designed and governed with you."
→ Focus on partnership and governance
→ Heavy on process explanation
→ Multiple competing frameworks (Signals, Context Elements, BCP)

### New Story:
"Build AI systems that scale with your operations."
→ Focus on outcomes and client ownership
→ Clear, simple approach explanation
→ Single, coherent methodology

### Messaging Improvements:
1. **Clearer value prop**: "We design the architecture. You own the execution."
2. **Better positioning**: Tool problem vs. systems problem
3. **Simpler approach**: 4 clear principles instead of technical stack
4. **Client-centric**: "You own" language throughout
